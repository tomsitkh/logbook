### API manage image file from local file system
In `application-local.properties` file, update `product.image.file.location` to certain local folder.

In `DemoController.cs`, use `Value` annotation to set `product.image.file.location` value into `productImageFileLocation` field.

```java
@Value("${product.image.file.location}")
private String productImageFileLocation;
```

Access API with path `/demoProductImage/{id}` accepts `id` as image filename.
And query the file using `Paths.get`.

```java
@RequestMapping("/demoProductImage/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<InputStreamResource> getProductImage(@PathVariable("id") String id) {
    Path file = Paths.get(productImageFileLocation, id + ".png");
```
